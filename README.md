## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:

```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000/patients](http://localhost:3000/patients)
[http://localhost:3000/doctors](http://localhost:3000/doctors)


Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
